# Portfolio project

This portfolio website was completed as part of the Fullstack Nanodegree. The [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework was used for layout and styling with customizations to colour and spacing. Random, placeholder images from [lorempixel.com](http://lorempixel.com/) were used to complete the layout.
